## Game Description:
This project is a Tetris game implemented using SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library). The game utilizes polymorphism and inheritance to handle different types of Tetris pieces. Players can move pieces left or right using the arrow keys, speed up piece falling using the down arrow key, and rotate pieces using the Z and X keys. Pressing Enter restarts the game.

### SFML Implementation:
SFML is used for graphics, window management, and input handling. It provides an efficient way to create interactive and visually appealing games.

### Polymorphism and Inheritance:
Polymorphism is utilized to handle different types of Tetris pieces (such as T, J, Z, etc.) through a common Piece class, allowing for code reuse and flexibility. Inheritance is used to create specific piece types that inherit behavior from the Piece class.

### Controls:
- Left Arrow: Move piece left
- Right Arrow: Move piece right
- Down Arrow: Speed up piece falling
- Z Key: Rotate piece counterclockwise
- X Key: Rotate piece clockwise
- Enter Key: Restart the game
